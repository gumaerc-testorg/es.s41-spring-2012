Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course ES.S41 _Speak Italian With Your Mouth Full_ as it was taught by Dr. Paola Rebusco in Spring 2012.

In this [Experimental Study Group seminar](http://esg.mit.edu/learninginnovation/undergraduate-seminars/), students learned conversational Italian and how to prepare delicious Italian meals, while developing an understanding of Italian culture. Each class consisted of three parts: language instruction, identification of cooking ingredients in Italian, and cooking instruction. The juxtaposition of language learning and cooking provided the students with a unique way to learn and practice Italian. This course was taught in a combination of English and Italian.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 6 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class: Language Instruction and Cooking
------------------------------------------

*   The first hour of each class was spent on grammar and vocabulary. The class was interactive and students actively participated.
*   The second hour of each class was spent identifying the Italian names for ingredients and cooking tools, and cooking a meal together.
*   Sometimes this schedule varied depending on the cooking activity; for example, if the class was baking a cake, cooking would happen first and language instruction would happen while the cake was in the oven.

Out of Class
------------

*   Students were required to read each week’s blog entry and complete some grammar or reading exercises.
*   Students were also required to pick one dish from that week’s class and replicate it on their own. They would bring a sample to class to get it critiqued.
