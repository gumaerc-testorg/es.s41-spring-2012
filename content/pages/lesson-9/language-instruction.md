Let's refresh some *vocabolario*!

- ***il bar*** *in Italia* is not a place where they serve just alcoholic drinks, but it refers also to a coffee house. People drink coffee at the bar all the time, mostly standing at the counter (Italian coffee is so small that you do not need to sit or carry it with you to drink it).
- ***caffè*** really refers to *espresso*, and it is served in a *tazzina* (*una tazza piccola* = a small cup).
- there is no small, medium, large: you either simply ask for *un caffè* (regular size), ***or caffè doppio/caffè lungo*** (double/long: it has a little more water) or ***caffè ristretto*** (literally "shrinked", more concentrated, with less water).
- ***caffè macchiato caldo***, "stained" with a tiny bit of warm frothed milk. *macchia* = spot, stain *macchiare* = to stain, *caldo* = hot.
- ***caffè macchiato freddo***, served with a tiny bit of cold/*freddo* milk on the side, in a small jug.
- ***cappuccino***, served in a cup, it needs no explanation, but if you order *cappuccino* in the city of Trieste you may be disappointed, as they would serve you a miniature *cappuccino*, similar to a *macchiato caldo*. Trieste has its own coffee vocabulary that you may want to check before a trip.
- ***marocchino*** (Literally "from Morocco"): espresso, frothed milk, cocoa powder, served in *una tazzina.*
- ***caffè corretto*** espresso "corrected" with a shot of liquor, typically *grappa* or *Sambuca.*
- ***caffè d'orzo***, espresso made from barley, it is decaf and the taste is different, worth trying. It can be ordered in all the variations, just like a normal *caffè*.
- ***caffè decaffeinato*** or ***caffè HAG*** (from the name of a common brand).
- ***d'estate*** (*di estate*, during the summer) you can find ***caffè freddo.***
- ***caffelatte*** (or *caffè latte*) is the American latte. We make it mostly at home for *colazione*, it is very rare to hear anyone ordering un *caffelatte al bar.*
- *a casa*, everyone makes *caffè* by using the italian coffee maker, called ***caffettiera*** (also called *moka*, or *Bialetti*, from the name of the original brand).
